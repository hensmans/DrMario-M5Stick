# Dr Mario

Multiple viruses have appeared on the screen and your goal is to remove them by creating groups of four or more of the same colour. Sometimes a bomb will drop, which will explode the surrounding blocks if it touches something. You win if you remove all the viruses on the board. But watch out, it gets more difficult with each subsequent game. More viruses will appear, the pills will fall more quickly and the screen will become expand.

Your high score will be saved locally, and you can select from four game modes in the menu. Sounds have also been implemented to make the experience more enjoyable and engaging. Players control the game by tilting the device for horizontal and vertical movement and pressing the button to rotate the pill.

This was created using an embedded device called the M5-Stick. This stick has a gyroscope, a screen, buttons, and a speaker.

The game has been programmed in C with the aim of keeping memory usage to a minimum.
